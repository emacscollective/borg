* Assimilate Emacs packages as Git submodules

Borg is a bare-bones package manager for Emacs packages.  It provides
only a few essential features and should be combined with other tools
such as [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]], [[https://github.com/emacscollective/epkg][epkg]], [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and [[https://github.com/tarsius/auto-compile][auto-compile]].

Borg assimilates packages into the =~/.emacs.d= repository as Git
submodules.  An assimilated package is called a drone and a borg-based
=~/.emacs.d= repository is called a collective.
