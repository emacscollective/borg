;;; Commentary:

;; The Borg assimilate Emacs packages as Git submodules.  Borg is
;; an alternative, bare-bones package manager for Emacs packages.

;; Please consult the manual for more information:
;; https://www.emacsmirror.net/manual/borg.

;; Borg can be used by itself or alongside `package.el'.  In the
;; latter case Borg itself should be installed from Melpa, which
;; is still experimental and not yet covered in the manual.  See
;; https://github.com/emacscollective/borg/issues/46 for now.
