@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

The Borg assimilate Emacs packages as Git submodules.

Borg is a bare-bones package manager for Emacs packages.  It provides
only a few essential features and should be combined with other tools
such as Magit, @code{epkg}, @code{use-package}, and @code{auto-compile}.

Borg assimilates packages into the @code{~/.emacs.d} repository as Git
submodules.  An assimilated package is called a drone and a borg-based
@code{~/.emacs.d} repository is called a collective.

It is possible to clone a package repository without assimilating it.
A cloned package is called a clone.

To learn more about this project, also read the blog post @footnote{@uref{https://emacsair.me/2016/05/17/assimilate-emacs-packages-as-git-submodules}.} in
which it was announced.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

To get started clone the @code{emacs.g} collective to @code{~/.emacs.d}.
Currently this is the only available collective and in this manual
we assume you use that.  This collective already assimilated a few
drones in addition to @code{borg} itself, namely @code{magit}, @code{epkg}, @code{use-package},
@code{auto-compile}, @code{git-modes}, @code{diff-hl}, and their dependencies.  These
drones are not required by @code{borg} but their use is highly recommended.

The @code{emacs.g} collective is available from three different locations:

@itemize
@item
@uref{https://github.com/emacscollective/emacs.g}

@item
@uref{https://gitlab.com/emacscollective/emacs.g}

@item
@uref{https://bitbucket.org/emacscollective/emacs.g}
@end itemize

Clone the repository from your preferred url to either @code{~/.emacs.d}, or
for testing purposes to any other location.  Then fetch and build the
assimilated drones using @code{make bootstrap}.  If you cloned to somewhere
else than @code{~/.emacs.d}, then you can use that configuration using
@code{emacs -Q --load /path/to/emacs.g/init.elc}.

For drones whose upstreams are on Github or Gitlab the @code{emacs.g}
collective uses the @code{ssh} protocol by default, which is a problem if you
don't have accounts there and have properly setup your keys.  Luckily
this can easily be fixed using:

@lisp
git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git@@github.com:
git config --global url.https://gitlab.com/.insteadOf git@@gitlab.com:
@end lisp

@node Startup
@chapter Startup

The @code{user-init-file}, @code{~/.emacs.d/init.el}, has to contain a call to
@code{borg-initialize}.  It should also set @code{package-enable-at-startup} to @code{nil}
unless you really want to use both @code{borg} and @code{package} at the same time.

@defun borg-initialize

This function initializes assimilated drones using @code{borg-activate}.

To skip the activation of the drone named DRONE, temporarily disable
it by setting the value of the Git variable @code{submodule.DRONE.disabled}
to true in @code{~/.emacs.d/.gitmodules}.
@end defun

@cindex borg-activate drone
@deffn Command borg-activate drone

This function activates the drone named DRONE by adding the
appropriate directories to the @code{load-path} and to @code{Info-directory-list},
and by loading the autoloads file, if it exits.

Unlike @code{borg-initialize}, this function ignores the Git variable
@code{submodule.DRONE.disabled}.
@end deffn

@node Assimilation
@chapter Assimilation

A third-party package is assimilated by adding it as a submodule and,
if necessary, by configuring it in @code{~/.emacs.d/init.el}.  Built-in
packages are assimilated merely by configuring them.

To begin the assimilation of a third-party package use the command
@code{borg-assimilate}, which adds the package's repository as a submodule
and attempts to build the drone.

A safer alternative is to first clone the package without assimilating
it, using @code{borg-clone}.  This gives you an opportunity to inspect the
cloned package for broken or malicious code before it gets a chance to
run arbitrary code.  Later you can proceed with the assimilation using
@code{borg-assimilate}, or remove the clone using @code{borg-remove}.

Building the drone can fail, for example due to missing dependencies.
Failure to build a drone is not considered as a failure to assimilate.
If a build fails, then a buffer containing information about the
issue pops up.  If the failure is due to unsatisfied dependencies,
then assimilate those too, and then build any drone which previously
couldn't be built by using the Emacs command @code{borg-build} or @code{make
lib/DRONE}.  Alternatively you can just rebuild everything using @code{make
build}.

If you wish to avoid such complications, you should use the command
@code{epkg-describe-package} before assimilating a package.  Among other
useful information, it also provides a dependency tree.

Once the packages have been added as submodules and the drones have
been built, the assimilation is completed by creating an assimilation
commit.

If you assimilate a single package, then it is recommended that you
use a message similar to this:

@example
Assimilate foo v1.0.0
@end example

Or if one or more dependencies had to be assimilated, something like:

@example
Assimilate foo and dependencies

Assimilate foo v1.0.0
Assimilate bar v1.1.0
Assimilate baz v0.1.0
@end example

It's usually a good idea not to assimilate unrelated packages in the
same commit, but something like this might make sense:

@example
Assimilate ido and extensions

Assimilate flx               v0.6.1-3-gae0981b
Assimilate ido-at-point      v1.0.0
Assimilate ido-ubiquitious   v3.12-2-g7354d98
Assimilate ido-vertical-mode v0.1.6-33-gb42e422
Assimilate smex               3.0-13-g55aaebe
@end example

Version strings as those shown above can be obtained using @code{git
describe --tags}, or by looking inside the "Modules" section of the
Magit status buffer of the @code{~/.emacs.d} repository.

@cindex borg-assimilate package url
@deffn Command borg-assimilate package url

This command assimilates the package named PACKAGE from URL.
@end deffn

@cindex borg-clone name url
@deffn Command borg-clone name url

This command clones the package named NAME from URL, without
assimilating it.  This is useful when you want to inspect the
package before potentially executing malicious or broken code.
@end deffn

@cindex borg-remove clone
@deffn Command borg-remove clone

This command removes the cloned or assimilated package named CLONE,
by removing the working tree from @code{borg-drone-directory}, regardless
of whether that repository belongs to an assimilated package or a
package that has only been cloned for review using @code{borg-clone}.  The
Git directory is not removed.
@end deffn

@cindex borg-build drone
@deffn Command borg-build drone

This command builds the drone named DRONE.  Interactively, or when
optional ACTIVATE is non-nil, then also activate the drone using
@code{borg-activate}.
@end deffn

@defun borg-update-autoloads drone &optional path

This function updates the autoload file for the libraries belonging
to the drone named DRONE in the directories in PATH.  PATH can be
omitted or contain file-names that are relative to the top-level of
DRONE's repository.
@end defun

@defun borg-byte-compile drone &optional path

This function compiles the libraries for the drone named DRONE in
the directories in PATH.  PATH can be omitted or contain file-names
that are relative to the top-level of DRONE's repository.
@end defun

@defun borg-makeinfo drone

This function generates the Info manuals and the Info index for the
drone named DRONE.
@end defun

@defun borg-batch-rebuild &optional quick

This function rebuilds all assimilated drones in alphabetic order,
except for Org which is rebuilt first.  It also rebuilds @code{init.el} and
@code{USER-REAL-LOGIN-NAME.el}.

This function is not intended for interactive use, but used to
implement the @code{make} targets described in the following section.

When optional QUICK is non-nil, then do not build drones for which
@code{submodule.DRONE.build-step} is set, assuming that those are the drones
that take longer to be built.
@end defun

@defun borg-batch-rebuild-init

This function rebuilds @code{init.el} and @code{USER-REAL-LOGIN-NAME.el}.  It is
not intended for interactive use.
@end defun

@node Updating drones
@chapter Updating drones

Borg does not provide an update command.  By not doing so, it empowers
you to update to exactly the commit you wish to update to, instead of
to "the" new version.

To determine the drones with you @emph{might} want to update, visit the Magit
status buffer of the @code{~/.emacs.d} repository and press @code{f m} to fetch
inside all submodules.  After you have done so, and provided there
actually are any modules with new upstream commits, a section titled
"Modules unpulled from @@@{upstream@}" appears.

Each subsection of that section represents a submodule with new
upstream commits.  Expanding such a subsection lists the new upstream
commits.  These commits can be visited by pressing @code{RET}, and the status
buffer of a submodule can be visited by pressing @code{RET} while point is
inside the heading of the respective submodule section.  To return to
the status buffer of @code{~/.emacs.d} press @code{q}.

Inside the status buffer of a submodule, you can pull the upstream
changes as usual, using @code{F u}.  If you wish you can inspect the changes
before doing so.  And you can also choose to check out another commit
instead of the upstream @code{HEAD}.

Once you have "updated" to a new commit, you should also rebuild the
drone using the command @code{borg-build}.  This may fail, e.g. due to new
dependencies.

Once you have resolved all issues you should create an "update
commit".  You can either create one commit per updated drone or you
can create a single commit for all updated drones, which ever you find
more appropriate.  However it is recommended that you use a message
similar to:

@example
Update foo to v1.1.0
@end example

Or for multiple packages:

@example
Update 2 drones

Update foo to v1.1.0
Update bar to v1.2.1
@end example

To update the Epkg package database use the command @code{epkg-update}.

@node Patching drones
@chapter Patching drones

By using Borg you can not only make changes to assimilated packages,
you can also keep track of those patches and share them with others.

If you created some commits in a drone repository and are the
maintainer of the respective package, then you can just push your
changes to the "origin" remote.  You don't have to do this every time
you created some commits, but at important checkpoints, such as after
creating a release, you should record the changes in the @code{~/.emacs.d}
repository.  To do so proceed as described in @ref{Updating drones,Updating drones}.

But for most packages you are not the maintainer and if you create
commits for such drones, then you have to create a fork and push there
instead.  You should configure that remote as the push-remote using
@code{git config remote.pushDefault FORK}, or pressing @code{b C M-p} in Magit.
After you have done that you can continue to pull from the upstream
using @code{P u} in Magit and you can also push to your fork using @code{P p}.

Of course you should also occasionally record the changes in the
@code{~/.emacs.d} repository.  Additionally, and ideally when you first
fork a drone, you should also record information about your personal
remote in the super-repository by setting @code{submodule.DRONE.remote} in
@code{~/.emacs.d/.gitmodules}.

@defvar submodule.DRONE.remote "NAME URL"

This variable specifies an additional remote named NAME that is
fetched from URL.  This variable can be specified multiple times.
Note that "NAME URL" is a single value and that the two parts of
that value are separated by a single space.

@code{make bootstrap} automatically adds all remotes that are specified
like this to the DRONE repository by setting @code{remote.NAME.url} to
URL and using the standard value for @code{remote.NAME.fetch}.
@end defvar

@defvar borg.pushDefault = FORK

This variable specifies a name used for push-remotes.  Because this
variable can only have one value it is recommended that you use the
same name, FORK, for your personal remote in all drone repositories
in which you have created patches that haven't been merged into the
upstream repository (yet).  A good value may be your username.

For all DRONES for which one value of @code{submodule.DRONE.remote}
specifies a remote whose NAME matches FORK, @code{make bootstrap}
automatically configures FORK to be used as the push-remote by
setting @code{remote.pushDefault} to FORK.
@end defvar

@node Make targets
@chapter Make targets

The following @code{make} targets are available in @code{~/.emacs.d/Makefile}.
To use them you have to be in @code{~/.emacs.d} in a shell.

@cindex make help
@deffn Command make help

This target prints information about the following targets.
@end deffn

@cindex make build
@deffn Command make build

This target builds all drones.

It also builds @code{init.el} and @code{USER-REAL-LOGIN-NAME.el}, if that exists.
Also see @code{make build-init} below.
@end deffn

@cindex make quick
@deffn Command make quick

This target builds @emph{most} drones.  Excluded are all drones for which
the Git variable @code{submodule.DRONE.build-step} is set, assuming that those
are the drones that take longer to build.

It also builds @code{init.el} and @code{USER-REAL-LOGIN-NAME.el}, if that exists.
Also see @code{make build-init} below.
@end deffn

@cindex make lib/DRONE
@deffn Command make lib/DRONE

This target builds the drone named DRONE.
@end deffn

@cindex make build-init
@deffn Command make build-init

This target builds @code{init.el} and @code{USER-REAL-LOGIN-NAME.el}, if that
exists.

If you publish your @code{~/.emacs.d} repository but would like to keep
some settings private, then you can do so by putting these in a file
@code{~/.emacs.d/FILE-NAME.el}.  If FILE-NAME matches the value of the
variable @code{user-real-login-name}, then the @code{init.el} of the emacs.g
collective automatically loads it.  The downside of this approach
is that you will have to somehow synchronize that file between your
machines without checking it into Git.
@end deffn

@cindex make bootstrap
@deffn Command make bootstrap

This target attempts to bootstrap the drones.  To do so it runs
@code{git submodule init}, @code{bin/bootstrap} (which see), and @code{make build}.

If an error occurs during the @code{bin/bootstrap} phase, then you can just
run that command again to process the remaining drones.  The drones
that have already been bootstrapped or that have previously failed
will be skipped.  If a drone cannot be cloned from any of the known
remotes, then you should temporarily remove it using @code{git submodule
  deinit lib/DRONE}.  When done with @code{bin/bootstrap} also manually run
@code{make build} again.
@end deffn

@node Lisp variables
@chapter Lisp variables

Borg doesn't have any user options or other configuration variables.
The values of the following variables are set at startup and should
not be changed by the user.

@defvar borg-drone-directory

The value of this constant is the directory beneath which drone
submodules are placed.  The value is set based on the location of
the @code{borg} library and should not be changed.
@end defvar

@defvar borg-user-emacs-directory

The value of this constant is the directory beneath which additional
per-user Emacs-specific files are placed.  The value is set based on
the location of the @code{borg} library and should not be changed.  The
value is usually the same as that of @code{user-emacs-directory}, except
when Emacs is started with @code{emacs -q -l /path/to/init.el}.
@end defvar

@defvar borg-gitmodules-file

The value of this constant is the ".gitmodules" file of the
super-repository.
@end defvar

@node Git variables
@chapter Git variables

The values of the borg-specific Git variables have to be set in the
file @code{~/.emacs.d/.gitmodules}.  The variables @code{borg.pushDefault} and
@code{submodule.DRONE.remote} are described in @ref{Patching drones,Patching drones}.

@defvar borg.collective = REMOTE

This variable specifies the name used for remotes that reference
a repository that has been patched by the collective.  If a NAME
matches REMOTE, then it is configured as the upstream of the
current branch of the respective DRONE.

If the file ".hive-maint" exists, then this variable has the same
effect as "borg.pushDefault".  This special case is only useful for
maintainers of the collective (but not for maintainers of
individual drones).
@end defvar

Because most repositories used to maintain Emacs packages follow some
common-sense conventions, Borg usually does not have to be told how to
build a given drone.  Building is done using @code{borg-build}, which in turn
usually does its work using @code{borg-update-autoloads}, @code{borg-byte-compile},
and @code{borg-makeinfo}.

However some packages don't follow the conventions either because they
are too complex to do so, or for the sake of doing it differently.
But in either case resistance is futile; by using the following
variables you can tell Borg how to build such packages.

@defvar submodule.DRONE.build-step COMMAND

This variable instructs @code{borg-build} to build the drone named DRONE
using COMMAND instead of @code{borg-update-autoloads}, @code{borg-byte-compile},
and @code{borg-makeinfo}.  COMMAND can be a shell command or an Emacs lisp
S-expression.  This variable can be specified multiple times.  The
COMMANDs are executed in the specified order.

@example
[submodule "mu4e"]
        path = lib/mu4e
        url = git@@github.com:djcb/mu.git
        build-step = test -e ./configure || autoreconf -i
        build-step = ./configure
        build-step = make -C mu4e > /dev/null
        build-step = "(borg-update-autoloads \"mu4e\")"
        load-path = mu4e
@end example

If this variable is set, then all default steps are skipped.
Therefore if the upstream build process does not cover all steps
which are normally performed by the Borg build process, then you
have to invoke some of the Borg steps explicitly.  In the above
example we do so by calling @code{borg-update-autoloads} with the
appropriate arguments.

Also note that just because a package provides a @code{Makefile}, you do
not necessarily have to use it.
@end defvar

@defvar submodule.DRONE.load-path PATH

This variable instructs @code{borg-activate} to add PATH to the @code{load-path}
instead of the directory it would otherwise have added.  Likewise it
instructs @code{borg-byte-compile} to compile the libraries in that
directory.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level of the
repository of the drone named DRONE.  This variable can be specified
multiple times.

Normally Borg uses @code{lisp/} as the drone's @code{load-path}, if that exists,
or else the top-level directory.  If this variable is set, then it
@emph{overrides} the default location.  Therefore, to @emph{add} an additional
directory, you also have to explicitly specify the default
locaction.

@example
[submodule "org"]
        path = lib/org
        url = git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
        build-step = make
        load-path = lisp
        load-path = contrib/lisp
        info-path = doc
@end example
@end defvar

@defvar submodule.DRONE.no-byte-compile PATH

This variable instructs @code{borg-byte-compile} to not compile the library
at PATH.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level of the repository
of the drone named DRONE.  This variable can be specified multiple
times.

Sometimes a drone comes with an optional library which adds support
for some other third-party package, which you don't want to use.
For example @code{emacsql} comes with a PostgreSQL back-end, which is
implemented in the library @code{emacsql-pg.el}, which requires the @code{pg}
package.  The standard Borg collective @code{emacs.g} assimilates @code{emacsql},
for the sake of the @code{epkg} drone, which only requires the SQLite
back-end.  To avoid an error about @code{pg} not being available, @code{emacs.g}
instructs Borg to not compile @code{emacsql-pg.el}.  (Of course if you want
to use the PostgreSQL back-end and assimilate @code{pg}, then you should
undo that.)
@end defvar

@defvar submodule.DRONE.info-path PATH

This variable instructs @code{borg-initialize} to add PATH to
@code{Info-directory-list}.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level of
the repository of the drone named DRONE.
@end defvar

@defvar submodule.DRONE.no-makeinfo PATH

This variable instructs @code{borg-makeinfo} to not create an Info file for
the Texinfo file at PATH.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level
of the repository of the drone named DRONE.  This variable can be
specified multiple times.
@end defvar

@defvar submodule.DRONE.disabled true|false

If the value of this variable is @code{true}, then it is skipped by
@code{borg-initialize}.
@end defvar

@node Low-level functions
@chapter Low-level functions

You normally should not have to use the following low-level functions
directly.  That being said, you might want to do so anyway if you
build your own tools on top of Borg.

@defun borg-worktree clone

This function returns the top-level of the working tree of the
package named CLONE.
@end defun

@defun borg-gitdir clone

This function returns the Git directory of the package named
CLONE.

It always returns @code{<borg-user-emacs-directory>/.git/modules/<CLONE>},
even when this repository's Git directory is actually located inside
the working tree.
@end defun

@defun borg-get drone variable &optional all

This function returns the value of the Git variable
@code{submodule.DRONE.VARIABLE} defined in @code{~/.emacs.d/.gitmodules}.  If
optional ALL is non-nil, then it returns all values as a list.
@end defun

@defun borg-get-all drone variable

This function returns all values of the Git variable
@code{submodule.DRONE.VARIABLE} defined in @code{~/.emacs.d/.gitmodules} as a
list.
@end defun

@defun borg-load-path drone

This function returns the @code{load-path} for the drone named DRONE.
@end defun

@defun borg-info-path drone &optional setup

This function returns the @code{Info-directory-list} for the drone named
DRONE.

If optional SETUP is non-nil, then it returns a list of directories
containing @code{texi} and/or @code{info} files.  Otherwise it returns a list of
directories containing a file named @code{dir}.
@end defun

@defun borg-drones &optional include-variables

This function returns a list of all assimilated drones.

The returned value is a list of the names of the assimilated
drones, unless optional INCLUDE-VARIABLES is non-nil, in which
case elements of the returned list have the form @code{(NAME . PLIST)}.

PLIST is a list of paired elements.  Property names are symbols
and correspond to a VARIABLE defined in the Borg repository's
@code{.gitmodules} file as @code{submodule.NAME.VARIABLE}.

Each property value is either a string or a list of strings.  If
INCLUDE-VARIABLES is @code{raw} then all values are lists.  Otherwise a
property value is only a list if the corresponding property name is
a member of @code{borg--multi-value-variables}.  If a property name isn't
a member of @code{borg--multi-value-variables} but it does have multiple
values anyway, then it is undefined with value is included in the
returned value.
@end defun

@defun borg-clones

This function returns a list of all cloned packages.

The returned value includes the names of all drones, as well as the
names of all other repositories that are located directly inside
@code{borg-drone-directory} but aren't tracked as submodules.
@end defun

@defun borg-read-package prompt

This function reads a package name and the url of its upstream
repository from the user, and returns them as a list.

When the package @code{epkg} is available, then the user is only prompted
for the name of the package, and the url is retrieved from the Epkg
database.  PROMPT is used when prompting for the package name.
@end defun

@defun borg-read-clone prompt

This function reads the name of a cloned package from the user.
@end defun

There exist a few more functions, but those are considered to be
internal and might therefore change in incompatible ways without that
being noted in the changelog.

@defun borg--maybe-absorb-gitdir pkg
@end defun
@defun borg--maybe-reuse-gitdir pkg
@end defun
@defun borg--restore-worktree pkg
@end defun
@defun borg--call-git pkg &rest args
@end defun
@defun borg--expand-load-path drone path
@end defun
@defun borg--sort-submodule-sections
