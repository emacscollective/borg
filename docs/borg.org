* Introduction

The Borg assimilate Emacs packages as Git submodules.

Borg is a bare-bones package manager for Emacs packages.  It provides
only a few essential features and should be combined with other tools
such as Magit, ~epkg~, ~use-package~, and ~auto-compile~.

Borg assimilates packages into the ~~/.config/emacs~ [fn:1] repository
as Git submodules.  An assimilated package is called a drone and a
borg-based ~~/.config/emacs~ repository is called a collective.

It is possible to clone a package repository without assimilating it.
A cloned package is called a clone.

To learn more about this project, also read the blog post [fn:2] in
which it was announced.

[fn:1] Or ~~/.emacs.d~ of course, if you prefer that or have to use the
old location because you still have to support older Emacs releases.
[fn:2] https://emacsair.me/2016/05/17/assimilate-emacs-packages-as-git-submodules.

* Installation

Borg can be used by itself, in which case it has to be bootstrapped.
This is how Borg originally was intended to be used exclusively, but
nowadays you may also choose to use it merely as a secondary package
manager, in which case Borg itself is installed using Package.

** Use as secondary package manager

To use Borg as a secondary package manager alongside Package, begin by
installing the former using the latter.  Borg is only available from
Melpa, so you have to add that first.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               (cons "melpa" "https://melpa.org/packages/")
               t)
#+end_src

Then you have to ~M-x package-refresh-contents RET~ before you can ~M-x
package-install RET borg RET~.  Doing that should add a verbose variant
of this to your init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables
   '(package-selected-packages '(borg)))
#+end_src

Then you have to make the two package managers aware of each other by
replacing the call to ~package-initialize~ in your init file with this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (if (require 'borg-elpa nil t)
      (borg-elpa-initialize)
    (package-initialize))
#+end_src

Just like Package (aka Elpa) defaults to installing packages in ~elpa/~,
Borg defaults to installing them in ~borg/~.  (When using both package
managers, that is.  If used by itself, then Borg defaults to using
~lib/~.)  If you want to use another directory, then you can do so by
setting the Git variable ~borg.drones-directory~.

You should also add a ~Makefile~ containing:

#+begin_src makefile
  BORG_SECONDARY_P = true
  include $(shell find -L elpa -maxdepth 1 -regex '.*/borg-[.0-9]*' |\
    sort | tail -n 1)/borg.mk
#+end_src

Despite its title, many things mentioned in the next section are
relevant even when Borg was installed the way we just did.  Just
saying.

** Bootstrapping

(As mentioned in the next section you can use a location other than
~~/.config/emacs~ (or ~~/.emacs.d~). Nevertheless most of the subsequent
examples just talk about ~~/.config/emacs~ and if you use something
else, then obviously have to substitute that.  The same applies to the
string ~lib~ and the variables ~user-init-file~ and ~user-emacs-directory~,
which also might not be appropriate depending on your choices.)

*** Bootstrapping using a seed

To get started clone the repository of the ~emacs.g~ collective.  A
"collective" is a starter-kit and/or configuration seed that relies on
Borg as the package manager.  Most users end up using ~emacs.g~ merely
as a bootstrapping seed and do not merge upstream changes after that.

This collective already assimilates a few drones in addition to ~borg~
itself, namely ~magit~, ~epkg~, ~use-package~, ~auto-compile~, ~git-modes~ and
~diff-hl~, as well as their dependencies.  These drones are not required
by ~borg~ but their use is highly recommended.

Clone the ~emacs.g~ repository to either ~~/.config/emacs~, or for testing
purposes to any other location.  This repository contains a ~Makefile~
that imports ~lib/borg/borg.mk~ and defines an additional target whose
purpose is to make that file and ~lib/borg/borg.sh~ available.  Run ~make
bootstrap-borg~ to clone the ~borg~ repository.  That does not completely
setup ~borg~ but it makes the latest version of the mentioned files
available.

Now that these files are available you can run ~make bootstrap~ to get
and configure all submodules (including the ~borg~ submodule) and to
build all drones.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone git@github.com:emacscollective/emacs.g.git ~/.config/emacs
  cd ~/.config/emacs
  make bootstrap-borg
  make bootstrap
#+end_src

If you have assimilated many packages, you might want to use ~make
bootstrap | tee bootstrap.log~.

The last command run during bootstrap is ~git submodule status~, which
prints one line per module.  If a line is prefixed with =+=, that means
that it was not possible to checkout the recorded commit, and ~-~ means
that the module could not be cloned.  Even if some module could not be
cloned, that usually does not render a configuration unusable, so just
run ~emacs~ now, and then investigate any issues from the comfort of
Magit.

If you cloned to somewhere other than ~~/.config/emacs~, then you can
use that configuration using ~emacs --init-directory /path/to/emacs.g/~,
provided you are using Emacs 29 or later.  Otherwise you have to
resort to ~emacs -Q -l /path/to/emacs.g/early-init.el -l
/path/to/emacs.g/init.el~.

For drones whose upstream repositories are located on Github or Gitlab
the ~emacs.g~ collective uses the ~ssh~ protocol by default, which is a
problem if you don't have accounts there and have not properly setup
your keys.  See [[*Using https URLs]].

During package compilation you may notice the submodules relating to
those packages become dirty due to the compilation outputs not being
ignored in those submodules.  For this reason it is useful to ignore
these outputs globally, for example in your ~~/.config/git/ignore~
file:

#+begin_src undefined
  *.elc
  *-autoloads.el
  dir
#+end_src

You may discover more things that you'll want to ignore this way as
you use ~borg~.

*** Bootstrapping from scratch

If you don't want to base your configuration on the ~emacs.g~
starter-kit described in the previous section, then you have
to do a few things manually.

#+begin_src sh
  git init ~/.config/emacs
  cd ~/.config/emacs
#+end_src

By default Borg installs packages inside the ~lib/~ subdirectory, but
since you are starting from scratch, you may choose something else
by setting the Git variable ~borg.drones-directory~ locally for this
repository.

Then you should add a ~Makefile~ containing at least:

#+begin_src makefile
  DRONES_DIR = $(shell git config "borg.drones-directory" || echo "lib")

  -include $(DRONES_DIR)/borg/borg.mk

  bootstrap-borg:
          @git submodule--helper clone --name borg --path $(DRONES_DIR)/borg \
          --url git@github.com:emacscollective/borg.git
          @cd $(DRONES_DIR)/borg; git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main
          @cd $(DRONES_DIR)/borg; git reset --hard HEAD
#+end_src

Now you are probably tempted to run ~make bootstrap-borg~, but that is
for bootstrapping /from a seed/, and what we are doing right now is to
bootstrap /from scratch/.  In the process we are creating a seed but we
are not there yet.  Instead run this:

#+begin_src sh
  git submodule add --name borg git@github.com:emacscollective/borg.git lib/borg
#+end_src

Now that ~borg~ is available we can build all the assimilated packages (currently
just ~borg~ itself) using ~make bootstrap~.

Now it is time to tell Emacs to initialize Borg instead of Package by
adding a simple ~init.el~ file containing at least:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (< emacs-major-version 27)
    (setq package-enable-at-startup nil))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lib/borg" user-emacs-directory))
  (require 'borg)
  (borg-initialize)
#+end_src

Beginning with Emacs 27.1, ~package-enable-at-startup~ has to be
disabled earlier, in ~early-init.el~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
#+end_src

Now you could create the initial commit but you could also delay that.

#+begin_src sh
  git commit -m "Assimilate borg"
#+end_src

Now it is time to assimilate some other essential packages.  You could
do so using ~M-x borg-assimilate~, but you would quickly notice that
doing so without the help of the ~epkg~ package is quite cumbersome,
so lets manually install that and its dependency first:

#+begin_src sh
  git submodule add --name closql git@github.com:emacscollective/closql.git lib/closql
  git submodule add --name emacsql git@github.com:magit/emacsql.git lib/emacsql
  git submodule add --name compat git@github.com:emacs-compat/compat.git lib/compat
  git submodule add --name llama https://git.sr.ht/~tarsius/llama lib/llama
  git submodule add --name epkg git@github.com:emacscollective/epkg.git lib/epkg
  git config -f .gitmodules submodule.emacsql.no-byte-compile emacsql-pg.el
  echo /epkgs/ >> .gitignore
  git add .gitignore .gitmodules
  make build
  git commit -m "Assimilate epkg and dependencies"
#+end_src

Once you have done that and have restarted Emacs, you can install
Magit using Borg, as described in [[*Assimilation]].  You should also
configure Magit status buffers to display submodules:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'magit
    (magit-add-section-hook 'magit-status-sections-hook
                            'magit-insert-modules
                            'magit-insert-stashes
                            'append))
#+end_src

Finally (look, nobody forced you to do this from scratch ;-) I
strongly suggest that you make yourself familiar with my ~auto-compile~
package.

*** Migrating a legacy configuration

If you are currently using Package and want to gently ease into using
Borg alongside that, then you can proceed as described in [[*Use as
secondary package manager]].

If on the other hand you are already manually using Git modules,
then you should proceed as described in [[*Bootstrapping from scratch]].
Obviously "from scratch" does not apply this time around, so just skip
steps like ~git init~.

*** Using your configuration on another machine

Getting started using your existing configuration on another machine
works the same way as described in [[*Bootstrapping using a seed]].  The
only difference is that instead of starting by cloning someone else's
repository you start by cloning your own repository.

*** Using https URLs

For drones whose upstream repositories are located on Github or Gitlab
the ~emacs.g~ collective uses the ~ssh~ protocol by default, which is a
problem if you don't have accounts there and have not properly setup
your keys.

Luckily this can easily be fixed using the following global rules.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git@github.com:
  git config --global url.https://gitlab.com/.insteadOf git@gitlab.com:
#+end_src

If you don't want to configure this globally, then you can also configure
Borg itself to prefer the ~https~ URLS.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq borg-rewrite-urls-alist
        '(("git@github.com:" . "https://github.com/")
          ("git@gitlab.com:" . "https://gitlab.com/")))
#+end_src

This does not affect packages that have already been assimilated.
During bootstrapping you have to change the URLs for packages that
are assimilated by default.

#+begin_src sh
  cd ~/.config/emacs
  sed -i "s|git@github.com:|https://github.com/|g" .gitmodules
  sed -i "s|git@gitlab.com:|https://gitlab.com/|g" .gitmodules
  git commit -m "Use https URLs for Github and Gitlab"
#+end_src

If you have already run ~make bootstrap~, then you also have to edit
~.git/config~.

#+begin_src sh
  cd ~/.config/emacs
  sed -i "s|git@github.com:|https://github.com/|g" .git/config
  sed -i "s|git@gitlab.com:|https://gitlab.com/|g" .git/config
#+end_src

* Startup

The ~user-init-file~, ~~/.config/emacs/init.el~, has to contain a call to
~borg-initialize~.

You should also set ~package-enable-at-startup~ to ~nil~.  If you use
Emacs 27 or later, then do so in ~early-init.el~, otherwise in ~init.el~.

- Function: borg-initialize ::

  This function initializes assimilated drones using ~borg-activate~.

  To skip the activation of the drone named DRONE, temporarily disable
  it by setting the value of the Git variable ~submodule.DRONE.disabled~
  to true in ~~/.config/emacs/.gitmodules~.

- Command: borg-activate clone ::

  This function activates the clone named CLONE by adding the
  appropriate directories to the ~load-path~ and to ~Info-directory-list~,
  and by loading the autoloads file, if it exists.

  Unlike ~borg-initialize~, this function ignores the Git variable
  ~submodule.DRONE.disabled~ and can be used to activate clones that
  have not been assimilated.

* Assimilation

A third-party package is assimilated by adding it as a submodule and,
if necessary, by configuring it in ~~/.config/emacs/init.el~.  Built-in
packages are assimilated merely by configuring them.

To begin the assimilation of a third-party package use the command
~borg-assimilate~, which adds the package's repository as a submodule
and attempts to build the drone.

A safer alternative is to first clone the package without assimilating
it, using ~borg-clone~.  This gives you an opportunity to inspect the
cloned package for broken or malicious code, before it gets a chance
to run arbitrary code.  Later you can proceed with the assimilation
using ~borg-assimilate~, or remove the clone using ~borg-remove~.

Building the drone can fail, for example due to missing dependencies.
Failure to build a drone is not considered as a failure to assimilate.
If a build fails, then a buffer containing information about the
issue pops up.  If the failure is due to unsatisfied dependencies,
then assimilate those too, and then build any drone, which previously
couldn't be built, by using the Emacs command ~borg-build~ or ~make
lib/DRONE~.  Alternatively you can just rebuild everything using ~make
build~.

If you wish to avoid such complications, you should use the command
~epkg-describe-package~ before assimilating a package.  Among other
useful information, it also provides a dependency tree.

Once the packages have been added as a submodules and the drones have
been built, the assimilation is completed by creating an assimilation
commit.

If you assimilate a single package, then it is recommended that you
use a message similar to this:

#+begin_src undefined
  Assimilate foo v1.0.0
#+end_src

Or if one or more dependencies had to be assimilated, something like:

#+begin_src undefined
  Assimilate foo and dependencies

  Assimilate foo v1.0.0
  Assimilate bar v1.1.0
  Assimilate baz v0.1.0
#+end_src

It's usually a good idea not to assimilate unrelated packages in the
same commit, but doing it for related packages, which do not strictly
depend on one another, it might make sense:

#+begin_src undefined
  Assimilate ido and extensions

  Assimilate flx               v0.6.1-3-gae0981b
  Assimilate ido-at-point      v1.0.0
  Assimilate ido-ubiquitous    v3.12-2-g7354d98
  Assimilate ido-vertical-mode v0.1.6-33-gb42e422
  Assimilate smex               3.0-13-g55aaebe
#+end_src

The command ~borg-insert-update-message~ can be used to generate such
commit messages.

- Key: C-c C-b [in git-commit-mode buffer] (borg-insert-update-message) ::

  This command insert information about drones that are changed in the
  index.  Formatting is according to the commit message conventions
  described above.

- Command: borg-assimilate package url &optional partially ::

  This command assimilates the package named PACKAGE from URL.

  If ~epkg~ is available, then only the name of the package is read in
  the minibuffer and the url stored in the Epkg database is used.  If
  ~epkg~ is unavailable, the package is not in the database, or if a
  prefix argument is used, then the url too is read in the minibuffer.

  If a negative prefix argument is used, then the submodule is added
  but the build and activation steps are skipped.  This is useful when
  assimilating a package that requires special build steps.  After
  configuring the build steps use ~borg-build~ to complete the
  assimilation.

- Command: borg-clone package url ::

  This command clones the package named PACKAGE from URL, without
  assimilating it.  This is useful when you want to inspect the
  package before potentially executing malicious or broken code.

  Interactively, when the ~epkg~ package is available, then the name
  is read in the minibuffer and the url stored in the Epkg database
  is used.  If ~epkg~ is unavailable, the package is unknown, or when
  a prefix argument is used, then the url is also read in the
  minibuffer.

- Command: borg-remove clone ::

  This command removes the cloned or assimilated package named CLONE,
  by removing the working tree from ~borg-drones-directory~, regardless
  of whether that repository belongs to an assimilated package or a
  package that has only been cloned for review using ~borg-clone~.  The
  Git directory is not removed.

- Command: borg-build clone &optional activate ::

  This command builds the clone named CLONE.  Interactively, or when
  optional ACTIVATE is non-nil, then also activate the drone using
  ~borg-activate~.

- Function: borg-update-autoloads clone &optional path ::

  This function updates the autoload file for the libraries belonging
  to the clone named CLONE in the directories in PATH.  PATH can be
  omitted or contain file-names that are relative to the top-level of
  CLONE's repository.

- Function: borg-compile clone &optional path ::

  This function compiles the libraries for the clone named CLONE in
  the directories in PATH.  PATH can be omitted or contain file-names
  that are relative to the top-level of CLONE's repository.

- Function: borg-maketexi clone &optional files ::

  This function generates Texinfo files from certain Org files for the
  clone named CLONE.  Org files that are located on ~borg-info-path~ are
  exported if their names match ~borg-maketexi-filename-regexp~ and the
  ~TEXINFO_DIR_HEADER~ export keyword is set in their content.

- Function: borg-makeinfo clone ::

  This function generates the Info manuals and the Info index for the
  clone named CLONE.

- Function: borg-batch-rebuild &optional quick ::

  This function rebuilds all assimilated drones in alphabetic order,
  except for Org which is rebuilt first.  After that it also builds
  the user init files using ~borg-batch-rebuild-init~.

  This function is not intended for interactive use; instead it is
  used by the Make target ~build~ described in the following section.

  When optional QUICK is non-nil, then this function does not build
  drones for which ~submodule.DRONE.build-step~ is set, assuming that
  those are the drones that take longer to be built.

- Function: borg-batch-rebuild-init ::

  This function builds the init files specified by the Make variable
  ~INIT_FILES~, or if that is unspecified ~init.el~ and ~LOGIN.el~, where
  ~LOGIN~ is the value of the variable ~user-real-login-name~.  If a file
  does not exist, then it is silently ignored.

  This function is not intended for interactive use; instead it is
  used by the Make targets ~build-init~ and (indirectly) ~build~, which
  are described in [[*Make targets]].

* Updating drones

Borg does not provide an update command.  By not doing so, it empowers
you to update to exactly the commit you wish to update to, instead of
to "the" new version.

To determine the drones that you /might/ want to update, visit the Magit
status buffer of the ~~/.config/emacs~ repository and press ~f m~ to fetch
inside all submodules.  After you have done so, and provided there
actually are any modules with new upstream commits, a section titled
"Modules unpulled from @{upstream}" appears.

Each subsection of that section represents a submodule with new
upstream commits.  Expanding such a subsection lists the new upstream
commits.  These commits can be visited by pressing ~RET~, and the status
buffer of a submodule can be visited by pressing ~RET~ while point is
inside the heading of the respective submodule section.  To return to
the status buffer of ~~/.config/emacs~ press ~q~.

Inside the status buffer of a submodule, you can pull the upstream
changes as usual, using ~F u~.  If you wish you can inspect the changes
before doing so.  And you can also choose to check out another commit
instead of the upstream ~HEAD~.

Once you have "updated" to a new commit, you should also rebuild the
drone using the command ~borg-build~.  This may fail, e.g., due to new
dependencies.

Once you have resolved all issues, you should create an "update
commit".  You can either create one commit per updated drone or you
can create a single commit for all updated drones, which ever you find
more appropriate.  However it is recommended that you use a message
similar to:

#+begin_src undefined
  Update foo to v1.1.0
#+end_src

Or for multiple packages:

#+begin_src undefined
  Update 2 drones

  Update foo to v1.1.0
  Update bar to v1.2.1
#+end_src

The command ~borg-insert-update-message~ can be used to generate such
commit messages.

To update the Epkg package database use the command ~epkg-update~.

* Patching drones

By using Borg you can not only make changes to assimilated packages,
you can also keep track of those patches and share them with others.

If you created some commits in a drone repository and are the
maintainer of the respective package, then you can just push your
changes to the "origin" remote.

You don't have to do this every time you created some commits, but at
important checkpoints, such as after creating a release, you should
record the changes in the ~~/.config/emacs~ repository.  To do so
proceed as described in [[*Updating drones]].

But for most packages you are not the maintainer and if you create
commits for such drones, then you have to create a fork and push there
instead.  You should configure that remote as the push-remote using
~git config remote.pushDefault FORK~, or by pressing ~b C M-p~ in Magit.
After you have done that, you can continue to pull from the upstream
using ~F u~ in Magit and you can also push to your fork using ~P p~.

Of course you should also occasionally record the changes in the
~~/.config/emacs~ repository.  Additionally, and ideally when you first
fork a drone, you should also record information about your personal
remote in the super-repository by setting ~submodule.DRONE.remote~ in
~~/.config/emacs/.gitmodules~.

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.remote "NAME URL" ::

  This variable specifies an additional remote named NAME that is
  fetched from URL.  This variable can be specified multiple times.
  Note that "NAME URL" is a single value and that the two parts of
  that value are separated by a single space.

  ~make bootstrap~ automatically adds all remotes that are specified
  like this to the DRONE repository by setting ~remote.NAME.url~ to
  URL and using the standard value for ~remote.NAME.fetch~.

- Variable: borg.pushDefault FORK ::

  This variable specifies a name used for push-remotes.  Because this
  variable can only have one value it is recommended that you use the
  same name, FORK, for your personal remote in all drone repositories
  in which you have created patches that haven't been merged into the
  upstream repository (yet).  A good value may be your username.

  For all DRONES for which one value of ~submodule.DRONE.remote~
  specifies a remote whose NAME matches FORK, ~make bootstrap~
  automatically configures FORK to be used as the push-remote by
  setting ~remote.pushDefault~ to FORK.

* Make targets

The following ~make~ targets are available by default.  To use them you
have to be in ~~/.config/emacs~ in a shell.  They are implemented in
~borg.mk~, which is part of the ~borg~ package.

To show the commands that are run, use ~V=1 make ...~.  Otherwise only
their output is shown.

** Help targets
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

- Command: help ::

  This target prints information about most of the following targets.

  This is the default target, unless the user sets ~.DEFAULT_GOAL~.

- Command: helpall ::

  This target prints information about all of the following targets.

** Batch targets
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

- Command: clean ::

  This target removes all byte-code and native files of all drones and
  config files.

  To ensure a clean build, this target should always be run before
  ~build~, so you might want to add a default target that does just
  that.  To do so, add this to ~~/.config/emacs/etc/borg/config.mk~:

  #+begin_src makefile-gmake
    .DEFAULT_GOAL := all
    all: clean build
  #+end_src

- Command: clean-force ::

  This target removes all byte-code files using ~find~.  The ~clean~
  target on the other hand uses the lisp function ~borg--batch-clean~.
  Byte-code isn't always compatible between Emacs releases and this
  target makes it possible to recover from such an incompatibility.

- Command: build ::

  This target byte-compiles Borg and Compat first, followed by all
  other drones in alphabetic order.  After that it also byte-compiles
  the user init files, like ~init-build~ does.

- Command: native ::

  This target byte-compiles and natively compiles Borg and Compat
  first, followed by all other drones in alphabetic order.  After that
  it also byte-compiles the user init files, like ~init-build~ does.

** Quick batch targets
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

These targets act on most drones but exclude those for which the Git
variable ~submodule.DRONE.build-step~ is set.  The assumption is that
those are the drones that take longer to build.

- Command: quick ::

  This target cleans and builds most drones.

  It also cleans and builds the init files as described for ~build~.

- Command: quick-clean ::

  This target removes all byte-code and native files of most drones
  It also remove the byte-code files of the config files.

- Command: quick-build ::

  This target builds /most/ drones and the config files

  It also builds the init files as described for ~build~.

** Drone targets
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

- Command: clean/DRONE ::

  This target removes all byte-code and native files belonging to the
  drone named DRONE.

- Command: build/DRONE ::

  This target byte-compiles the drone named DRONE.

  ~lib/DRONE~ is an alias for this target; or rather ~DIR/DRONE~, where
  ~DIR~ is directory containing the drone submodules.

- Command: native/DRONE ::

  This target byte-compiles and natively-compiles the drone named
  DRONE.

** Init file targets
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

- Command: init-clean ::

  This target removes byte-code files for init files.

- Command: init-tangle ::

  This target tangles (creates) ~init.el~ from ~init.org~.  You obviously
  don't have to use such a file, if you don't want to.

- Command: init-build ::

  This target byte-compiles the init files specified by the make
  variable ~INIT_FILES~; or if that is unspecified ~init.el~ and ~LOGIN.el~
  (where ~LOGIN~ is the value of the variable ~user-real-login-name~).
  If an init file does not exist, then that is silently ignored.

  If you publish your ~~/.config/emacs~ repository but would like to
  keep some settings private, then you can do so by putting them in a
  file ~~/.config/emacs/LOGIN.el~.  The downside of this approach is
  that you will have to somehow synchronize that file between your
  machines without checking it into Git.

** Bootstrap targets
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

- Command: bootstrap-borg ::

  This target bootstraps ~borg~ itself.

- Command: bootstrap ::

  This target attempts to bootstrap the drones.  To do so it runs
  ~git submodule init~, ~borg.sh~ (which see), and ~make build~.

  If an error occurs during the ~borg.sh~ phase, then you can just run
  that command again to process the remaining drones.  The drones that
  have already been bootstrapped or that have previously failed will
  be skipped.  If a drone cannot be cloned from any of the known
  remotes, then you should temporarily remove it using ~git submodule
  deinit lib/DRONE~.  When done with ~borg.sh~ also manually run ~make
  build~ again.

* Variables

- Variable: borg.drones-directory DIRECTORY ::

  This Git variable can be used to override the name of the directory
  that contains the drone submodules.  If specified, the value has to
  be relative to the top-level directory of the repository.

  Note that if you change the value of this variable, then you might
  have to additionally edit ~~/.config/emacs/Makefile~.

The values of the following variables are set at startup and should
not be changed by the user.

- Variable: borg-drones-directory ::

  The value of this constant is the directory beneath which drone
  submodules are placed.  The value is set based on the location of
  the ~borg~ library and the Git variable ~borg.drones-directory~ if set,
  and should not be changed.

- Variable: borg-user-emacs-directory ::

  The value of this constant is the directory beneath which additional
  per-user Emacs-specific files are placed.  The value is set based on
  the location of the ~borg~ library and should not be changed.  The
  value is usually the same as that of ~user-emacs-directory~, except
  when Emacs is started with ~emacs -q -l /path/to/init.el~.

- Variable: borg-gitmodules-file ::

  The value of this constant is the ~.gitmodules~ file of the
  super-repository.

The value of this Make variable has to be set in
~~/.config/emacs/Makefile~.

- Variable: INIT​_FILES ::

  A list of init files to be build by the Make targets ~build~ and
  ~build-init~.  See [[*Make targets]].

The values of these borg-specific Git variables have to be set in the
file ~~/.config/emacs/.gitmodules~.  The variables ~borg.pushDefault~ and
~submodule.DRONE.remote~ are described in [[*Patching drones]].

Because most repositories used to maintain Emacs packages follow some
common-sense conventions, Borg usually does not have to be told how to
build a given drone.  Building is done using ~borg-build~, which in turn
usually does its work using ~borg-update-autoloads~, ~borg-compile~,
~borg-maketexi~, and ~borg-makeinfo~.

However some packages don't follow the conventions either because they
are too complex to do so, or for the sake of doing it differently.
But in either case resistance is futile; by using the following
variables you can tell Borg how to build such packages.

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.build-step COMMAND ::

  By default drones are built using the lisp functions
  ~borg-update-autoloads~, ~borg-compile~, ~borg-maketexi~, and
  ~borg-makeinfo~, but if this variable has one or more values, then
  DRONE is built using these COMMANDs *instead*.

  Each COMMAND can be one of the default steps, an S-expression, or
  a shell command.  The COMMANDs are executed in the specified order.

  If a COMMAND matches one of default steps, then it is evaluated with
  the appropriate arguments.

  If a COMMAND begins with a parenthesis, then it is evaluated as
  a lisp expression.  In that case the variable ~borg-clone~ holds
  the name of the package that is being build.  To make a function
  available in this context, you usually have to define or load it
  in =etc/borg/config.el=, relative to ~borg-user-emacs-directory~.

  Otherwise COMMAND is assumed to be a shell command and is executed
  with ~shell-command~.

  #+BEGIN_SRC undefined
    [submodule "mu4e"]
            path = lib/mu4e
            url = git@github.com:djcb/mu.git
            build-step = test -e ./configure || autoreconf -i
            build-step = ./configure
            build-step = make -C mu4e > /dev/null
            build-step = borg-update-autoloads
            load-path = mu4e
  #+END_SRC

  To skip generating "autoloads" (e.g., using ~use-package~ to create
  "autoloads" on the fly), just provide the required build steps to
  build the package, omitting ~borg-update-autoloads~. Borg silently
  ignores a missing "autoloads" file during initialization
  (~borg-initialize~).

  #+BEGIN_SRC undefined
    [submodule "multiple-cursors"]
            path = lib/multiple-cursors
            url = git@github.com:magnars/multiple-cursors.el.git
            build-step = borg-compile
  #+END_SRC

  Note that just because a package provides a ~Makefile~, you do not
  necessarily have to use it.

  Even if ~make~ generates the Info file, you might still have to add
  ~borg-makeinfo~ as an additional build-step because the former might
  not generate an Info index file (named ~dir~), which Borg relies on.

  Also see ~borg.extra-build-step~ below.

- Variable: borg-build-shell-command ::

  This variable can be used to change how shell commands specified
  by ~submodule.DRONE.build-step~ are run.  The default value is ~nil~,
  meaning that each build step is run unchanged using ~shell-command~.

  If the value is a string, then that is combined with each build step
  in turn and the results are run using ~shell-command~.  This string
  must contain either %s, which is replaced with the unchanged build
  step, or %S, which is replaced with the result of quoting the build
  step using ~shell-quote-argument~.

  If the value is a function, then that is called once with the drone
  as argument and must return either a string or a function.  If the
  returned value is a string, then that is used as described above.

  If the value returned by the first function is another function, then
  this second function is called for each build step with the drone and
  the build step as arguments.  It must return a string or ~nil~.  If the
  returned value is a string, then that is used as described above.

  Finally the second function may execute the build step at its own
  discretion and return ~nil~ to indicate that it has done so.

  Notice that if the value of this variable is a function, this
  function must a) be defined in a drone; and b) be registered as an
  autoload.  This is because build happens in a separate Emacs process
  started with ~-Q --batch~, which only receives the name of the function.

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.load-path PATH ::

  This variable instructs ~borg-activate~ to add PATH to the ~load-path~
  instead of the directory it would otherwise have added.  Likewise it
  instructs ~borg-compile~ to compile the libraries in that directory.
  PATH has to be relative to the top-level of the repository of the
  drone named DRONE.  This variable can be specified multiple times.

  Normally Borg uses ~elisp/~ as the drone's ~load-path~, if that exists;
  otherwise ~lisp/~, if that exists; or else the top-level directory.
  If this variable is set, then it /overrides/ the default location.
  Therefore, to /add/ an additional directory, you also have to
  explicitly specify the default location.

  #+BEGIN_SRC undefined
    [submodule "org"]
            path = lib/org
            url = git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
            build-step = make
            load-path = lisp
            load-path = contrib/lisp
            info-path = doc
  #+END_SRC

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.no-byte-compile PATH ::

  This variable instructs ~borg-compile~ to not compile the library at
  PATH.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level of the repository of
  the drone named DRONE.  This variable can be specified multiple
  times.

  Sometimes a drone comes with an optional library which adds support
  for some other third-party package, which you don't want to use.
  For example ~emacsql~ comes with a PostgreSQL back-end, which is
  implemented in the library ~emacsql-pg.el~, which requires the ~pg~
  package.  The standard Borg collective ~emacs.g~ assimilates ~emacsql~,
  for the sake of the ~epkg~ drone, which only requires the SQLite
  back-end.  To avoid an error about ~pg~ not being available, ~emacs.g~
  instructs Borg to not compile ~emacsql-pg.el~.  (Of course if you want
  to use the PostgreSQL back-end and assimilate ~pg~, then you should
  undo that.)

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.recursive-byte-compile BOOLEAN ::

  Setting this variable to ~true~ instructs ~borg-compile~ to compile
  DRONE's directories recursively.  This isn't done by default because
  there are more repositories in which doing so would cause issues
  than there are repositories that would benefit from doing so.

  Unfortunately many packages put problematic test files or (usually
  outdated) copies of third-party libraries into subdirectories.  The
  latter is a highly questionable thing to do, but the former would be
  perfectly fine, if only the non-library lisp files did not provide
  a feature (which effectively turns them into libraries) and/or if a
  file named ~.nosearch~ existed in the subdirectory.  That file tells
  functions such as ~normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path~ and
  ~borg-compile~ to ignore the containing directory.

- Variable: borg-compile-function ::

  The function used to compile each individual library.
  One of ~byte-compile-file~, ~borg-byte+native-compile~ or
  ~borg-byte+native-compile-async~.

  To enable native compilation when running ~make~, use one of the
  respective make targets, as described in [[*Make targets]].

- Variable: borg-compile-recursively ::

  Setting this variable to a non-nil value instructs ~borg-compile~
  to compile all drones recursively.  Doing so is discouraged.

- Variable: borg-native-compile-deny-list ::

  This variable lists the names of files to be excluded from native
  compilation.

- Variable: borg.extra-build-step COMMAND ::

  This variable instructs Borg to execute COMMAND after the default
  build-steps for each DRONE (or after ~submodule.DRONE.build-step,~ if
  that specified).  It has to be set in ~borg-gitmodules-file~ and can
  have multiple values.

  If a COMMAND begins with a parenthesis, then it is evaluated as
  a lisp expression.  In that case the variable ~borg-clone~ holds
  the name of the package that is being build.  To make a function
  available in this context, you usually have to define or load it
  in =etc/borg/config.el=, relative to ~borg-user-emacs-directory~.

  Otherwise COMMAND is assumed to be a shell command and is executed
  with ~shell-command~.

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.info-path PATH ::

  This variable instructs ~borg-initialize~ to add PATH to
  ~Info-directory-list~.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level of
  the repository of the drone named DRONE.

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.no-maketexi PATH ::

  This variable instructs ~borg-maketexi~ to not create a Texinfo file
  for the Org file at PATH.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level
  of the repository of the drone named DRONE.  This variable can be
  specified multiple times.

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.no-makeinfo PATH ::

  This variable instructs ~borg-makeinfo~ to not create an Info file for
  the Texinfo file at PATH.  PATH has to be relative to the top-level
  of the repository of the drone named DRONE.  This variable can be
  specified multiple times.

- Variable: submodule.DRONE.disabled true|false ::

  If the value of this variable is ~true~, then it is skipped by
  ~borg-initialize~.

- Variable: borg-rewrite-urls-alist ::

  An alist that can optionally be used to rewrite certain URLs.  Each
  element has the form ~(ORIG . BASE)~.  Each URL that starts with ORIG
  is rewritten to start with BASE instead.  See [[*Using https URLs]].

- Variable: borg-maketexi-filename-regexp ::

  A regexp matching Org files that may be exported to Texinfo by
  ~borg-maketexi~.  The name of the clone is substituted for ~%s~.
  Setting this to ~nil~ disables the export of any Org files.

* Low-level functions

You normally should not have to use the following low-level functions
directly.  That being said, you might want to do so anyway if you
build your own tools on top of Borg.

- Function: borg-worktree clone ::

  This function returns the top-level of the working tree of the
  clone named CLONE.

- Function: borg-gitdir clone ::

  This function returns the Git directory of the clone named CLONE.

  It always returns ~BORG-USER-EMACS-DIRECTORY/.git/modules/CLONE~, even
  when CLONE's Git directory is actually located inside the working
  tree.

- Macro: borg-do-drones (var [result]) body...) ::

  This macro loop over drones.  BODY is evaluated with VAR bound to
  each drone, in turn.  Inside BODY variables set in ~.gitmodules~ are
  cached.  Then RESULT is evaluated to get the return value,
  defaulting to nil.

- Function: borg-get clone variable &optional all ::

  This function returns the value of the Git variable
  ~submodule.CLONE.VARIABLE~ defined in ~~/.config/emacs/.gitmodules~.
  If optional ALL is non-nil, then it returns all values as a list.

- Function: borg-get-all clone variable ::

  This function returns all values of the Git variable
  ~submodule.CLONE.VARIABLE~ defined in ~~/.config/emacs/.gitmodules~ as a
  list.

- Function: borg-load-path clone ::

  This function returns the ~load-path~ for the clone named CLONE.

- Function: borg-info-path clone &optional setup ::

  This function returns the ~Info-directory-list~ for the clone named
  CLONE.

  If optional SETUP is non-nil, then it returns a list of directories
  containing ~texi~ and/or ~info~ files.  Otherwise it returns a list of
  directories containing a file named ~dir~.

- Function: borg-dronep name ::

  This function returns non-nil if a drone named NAME exists.

  If that is set in ~.gitmodules~, then it returns the value of
  ~submodule.NAME.path~, nil otherwise.

- Function: borg-drones &optional include-variables ::

  This function returns a list of all assimilated drones.

  The returned value is a list of the names of the assimilated
  drones, unless optional INCLUDE-VARIABLES is non-nil, in which
  case elements of the returned list have the form ~(NAME . ALIST)~.

  ALIST is an association list.  Property names are symbols
  and correspond to a VARIABLE defined in the Borg repository's
  ~.gitmodules~ file as ~submodule.NAME.VARIABLE~.

  Each property value is either a string or a list of strings.  If
  INCLUDE-VARIABLES is ~raw~ then all values are lists.  Otherwise a
  property value is only a list if the corresponding property name is
  a member of ~borg--multi-value-variables~.  If a property name isn't
  a member of ~borg--multi-value-variables~ but it does have multiple
  values anyway, then it is undefined with value is included in the
  returned value.

- Function: borg-clones ::

  This function returns a list of all cloned packages.

  The returned value includes the names of all drones, as well as the
  names of all other repositories that are located directly inside
  ~borg-drones-directory~ but aren't tracked as submodules.

- Function: borg-read-package prompt &optional edit-url ::

  This function reads a package name and the url of its upstream
  repository from the user, and returns them as a list.

  When the ~epkg~ package is available, then the user is only prompted
  for the name of the package, and the upstream url is retrieved from
  the Epkg database.  If the package isn't in the database then the
  url has to be provided by the user.  If optional EDIT-URL is
  non-nil, then the url from the database, if any, is provided as
  initial input for the user to edit.

  PROMPT is used when prompting for the package name.

- Function: borg-read-clone prompt ::

  This function reads the name of a cloned package from the user.

There exist a few more functions, but those are considered to be
internal and might therefore change in incompatible ways without that
being noted in the change log.

- Function: borg--maybe-absorb-gitdir pkg ::
- Function: borg--maybe-reuse-gitdir pkg ::
- Function: borg--restore-worktree pkg ::
- Function: borg--call-git pkg &rest args ::
- Function: borg--expand-load-path drone path ::
- Function: borg--sort-submodule-sections ::
